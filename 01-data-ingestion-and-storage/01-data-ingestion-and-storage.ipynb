    "**Defination:** Data that is organized in a defined manner or schema typically found in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characterstics:**\n",
    "- Easily queryable\n",
    "- Organized in rows and columns\n",
    "- Has a consistent structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Database tables\n",
    "- CSV files\n",
    "- Excel spreadsheets\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Data that doesn't have a predefined structure or schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Not easily queryable without preprocessing\n",
    "- May come in various formats\n",

    "**Definition:** Data that is not as organized as structured data but has some level of structure in the form of tags, hierarchies, or other patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Elements might be tagged or categorized in some way\n",
    "- More flexible than structured data but not as chaotic as unstructured data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- XML and JSON files\n",
    "- Email headers (which have a mix of structured fields like date, subject, etc., and unstructured data in the body)\n",
    "- Log files with varied formats"
